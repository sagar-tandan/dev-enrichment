# 1. Introduction to Server-Side Developemmt with Node.js

---

Before we discuss about the **Node.js**, we need to understand a bit about JavaScript and its history.

**JavaScript** is a programming language that is used to create interactive contents on websites. Whenever we write a JavaScript code, we run the code inside the browser. This is because a browser like Chrome has built-in **JavaScript Engine** that can execute JavaScript code. The one of the most popular JavaScript engine is **V8 engine**, developed by Google.

Originally, It **was not** possible to run JavaScript outside the browser as we need JavaScript engine for that which is available only inside the browser.

So, **how do we run JavaScript outside the browser**? In 2009, one of the software engineer named **Ryan Dahl** comes with an idea: He took **V8 engine of Chrome (written in C++)** and embedded it with C++ program. This integration of V8 engine with C++ gives birth to a new C++ application called **Node.js**.

**\*Node.js** is main reason JavaScript can now run outside the browser\*.

### 1. What is Node.js?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser.

### 2. What is NPM?

NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It is default package manager for Node.js that is used to find, install and manage the packages (modules or libraries) written in JavaScript.

**Example:**

While building a server, we might use:

- **Express:** to create and manage server easily.
- **Mongoose:** to connect and work with MongoDB database.
- **bcrypt:** to hash password for security reasons.
- **jsonwebtoken:** to handle user's login tokens.

All of these packages can be installed and managed using `npm`.

## Setting up Node.js on our Machine

Follow the following steps for installation:

###### 1. **Download Node.js**

- Visit the official site of Node.js: https://nodejs.org
- Download the **LTS (Long Term Support)** version

###### 2. Install Node.js

###### 3. Verify Installation

Open Command terminal or PowerShell and run:

```cmd
node -v
npm -v
```

Output looks something like this:

## Creating our first Node.js project

###### Step 1: Create a folder named as "Summer Enrichment"

###### Step 2: Open that folder in VS code

###### Step 3: Now, create a new folder named as "Backend" inside it

We can do it manually or we can just open the terminal from the top right side of VS code and run this `mkdir Backend` command:

###### Step 4: Navigate inside "Backend" folder

We can use this command: `cd <Name of Folder>`

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250607193656.png)
Now we are inside **Backend** folder. All the backend code will be written inside this folder.

###### Step 5: Initialize `npm`

Now, we need to initialize npm using this command `npm init`

Here, i just added **author** by myself and just pressed enter button for else and finally i pressed **y** button and my folder structure will look like this:
![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250607194244.png)

###### Step 6: Create entry file

Here, we need to create our main file which is our entry point file. We can name it anything but i am naming it as `server.js`. We can create it manually or using this command in terminal `new-item server.js`.

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250607194659.png)

Now, my folder structure will looks like this:

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250607194742.png)

###### Step 7: Modifying `package.json`

Now, we need to make some changes on `package.json` file before we start building our server. This is what initial `package.json` looks like:

```js
{
  "name": "backend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Sagar Tandan",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": ""
}
```

First, we need to add `"type" : "module"` after "name". This allows us to use import and export , instead of require function, which was used in older version of JavaScript.

```js
{
  "name": "backend",
  "type":"module" ,
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Sagar Tandan",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": ""
}
```

Now, inside `scripts`, we need to add `"start": "node server.js"`. This helps us to run our **server.js** file whenever we use `npm start` in our terminal.

```js
{
  "name": "backend",
  "type": "module",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  "author": "Sagar Tandan",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": ""
}
```

All set. In next phase, we will be discussing about the **Express.js** and build simple server.
