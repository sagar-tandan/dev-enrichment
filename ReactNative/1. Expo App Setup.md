### 1. Initialize a new Expo app

We'll use `npx create-expo-app@latest` to initialize a new Expo app. It is a command line tool to create a new React Native project. Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest folderName
cd folderName
```

This command will create a new project directory with `folderName` defined above, using the default template. This template has essential boilerplate code and libraries needed to build our app, including Expo Router. 

### 2. Reset Project

Now, we will be building our app from scratch and learn basic fundamentals. Let's run `npm run reset-project` in terminal to remove boilerplate code. 
```bash
npm run reset-project
```
After running the above command, there are two files (**index.tsx** and **_layout.tsx**) left inside the app directory.

### 3. Run the app on mobile and web

In the project directory, run the following command to start the development server from the terminal:
```bash
npx expo start 
```
After running the above command, the development server will start, and we'll see a **QR code** inside the terminal window.
1. On Android, use the **Expo Go** app > Scan QR code option. 
2. On iOS, use the default camera app.
3. To run the web app, press **w** in the terminal. It will open the web app in the default web browser.

And all set. We have successfully created our first app.
